# Saurabh Je Singh

Hi! I'm **Je**. I create web applications for fun. When I'm not enjoying that, I study ML for a different kind of fun. And when I don't want to have any kind of fun, I think about the time in 7th grade when I tried to befriend a **brick**—well, more like my own pet brick.



## Connect with me!

I'm trying to limit my social media interaction, so please bear with me here:

- [Saurabhje](https://saurabhje.vercel.app/)
	> My personal blog, where i talk about random things, not enough content to be explored though, but enough to give you a rough idea about my megamind brain.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhje/)
	> I honestly don't know why I even bothered giving this link; there is literally nothing. It's because I hate this platform with my core.

## Something to liveby
"premature optimization is the root of all evil" - the art of computer programming by **Donald knuth**

## Theory

**Je's Uncertainty Principle (Quantum Programming)**
$\Delta x . \Delta p \ge h/2$
Where $\Delta x$ represents **efficiency**, and $\Delta x$ represents **meeting deadlines**—there's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know and control both simultaneously in the quantum realm of coding!
